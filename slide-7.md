#TL;DR

* Padrino builds on top of/extends Sinatra
* Easy to cherry pick the stuff you want
* Padrino != Rails




* Play around with it on a side project
* Using something that's not rails, you learn a lot about what rails gives you
* It's niche



##Remember 

You're using Sinatra, you're trying to be lean 
Padrino is tasty crispy bacon but it adds fat - use it sparingly
