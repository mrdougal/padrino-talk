#TL;DR

* Padrino builds on top of/extends Sinatra <!-- less perceived risk -->
* Easy to cherry pick the stuff you want <!-- easy to stay lean -->
* Padrino != Rails
             
             
<!-- this is my advice if you're going to play around with Padrino -->
             
* Play around with it on a side project
* Using something that's not rails, you learn a lot about what rails gives you
* It's niche 



##Remember 

You're using Sinatra, you're trying to be lean 
Padrino is tasty crispy bacon but it adds fat - use it sparingly
