#How (I think) most people experience Sinatra

<!-- Using a lightweight framework is more stylistic rather than a technical constraint -->

My side-project wanted to use/discover something different.
Not a good business decision but ok for a side project

Was **loving** Sinatra

* lightweight
* boots super quick
* enjoyed the change <!-- obviously not for everyone -->
* i felt smart - (purely objectionable)










<!-- Then you say things like this -->

##"I"m going to use Sinatra on everything, i don't need rails…"

Then I went to build a form - Sinatra doesn't have any
<!-- obviously didn't far through my side-project -->


* Start rolling your own form helper
* You start extracting “only the bits of ActiveSupport you need”
  * Similar to removing just one USB cable from your bottom drawer
* You start concatenating strings, like it's the only advice you got on stack-overflow

        
You discover you can write hideous ruby code

        TODO insert "example" horror code in front of many rubists
